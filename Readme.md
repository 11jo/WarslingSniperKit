## Description:
------------

The sling is a difficult weapon to master, but in the hands of a
warsling sniper it becomes a precise tool of war. Although slings
are commonly associated with and used by the hin, experts of the
weapon may indeed come from any race.

Advantages:

- +1 bonus to hit and damage with missile weapons at first level
  and every 4 levels afterward
- At 10th level he gains the Improved Ricochet passive ability
  which allows all fired missiles to bounce off their primary
  target and hit one additional nearby foe

Disadvantages:

- May not specialize in any weapon other than the sling
- May not wear armor greater than studded leather
- Hit Die: d8
